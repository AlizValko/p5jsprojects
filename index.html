        <h3>Dan Shiffman from the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain" target="_blank">The Coding Train</a> said that 'A great exercise that you can do to express your creativity, is invent a new way of showing time.' so that is what I did in this very simple project. The hours, minutes and seconds are represented by different colored bubbles and their size depends on what time it is at the moment.</h3>

        <h3>I was inspired to make this project when I saw <a>this</a> video of The Coding Train in which he explained how we can get the RGBA values of each pixel from a surface in this case the captured video.</h3>
        <h3>So the way this works is: the image the camera captures is scaled down in resoulution, then an array is crated storing the RGBA values of each pixel. I avaraged the RGB values of each to get a grayscale version of the image, then compared the brightness of each pixel and assigned a letter to it. The brighter the pixel the less "ink" is needed for the assigned letter. So the bright pixels are either a colon, a semicolon or a period, the darker ones are M, N, W or X and the midtones are k, c, d or x.</h3>

        <h3>For our first challenge, we were asked to create an interactive game or
            demonstration that uses the camera's view as its primary input. In one of the lectures,
            we were shown a code snippet that made a two-dimensional ball bounce around on
            the screen. I found this code to be easy to understand and the bounce was satisfying
            to watch, which inspired my (first) design. I thought about how I could merge the ball
            animation with facial features. What I came up with is the following: The user's
            eyeballs have fallen out of their face, and they have to catch them with their empty
            eye sockets to win. To add to the morbid theme, I also added droplets of blood that
            appear whenever the balls touch the side of the screen.</h3>

        <h3>Since the previous code only uses the position of the eyes, I was not satisfied with it
            completely. I made another interactive game which uses the PoseNet model, the one
            we learned about in the third lecture. This game shows a random time of the day and
            asks the user to aim his/her hands in the directions where an analogue clock's hands
            would go. It sounds easy at first but what makes it a bit challenging is that the view of
            the camera is flipped.</h3>

        <h3>After I handed in the previous two projects the funniest thing happened. I was told that the next project is going to be making a clock! I decided not to start a new clock but to improve on my already existing bubble clock. So I added hands and made it interactive; the user can press 'P' to make the bubbles pop (then 'P' again to bring them back), and 'F' to make them float.</h3>
